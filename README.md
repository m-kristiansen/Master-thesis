# Master thesis 
This readme will work as a workflow guide during the final masters year. It will contain the things that are done, how to proseed and maybe some remarks.

- [x] Create a solver for the Poisson equation with a manufactured solution using FEniCS. 
- [x] Prove Riesz representation theorem and the Lax Milgram theorem.
- [ ] Prove existence of solutions for the weak formulation of the Poisson equation. 
- [ ] Compare weak and strong solution.
- [ ] Derive a priori estimates for the finite element method. 
- [ ] Compare expected and true convergence rates as a function of grid refinement with manufactured solutions. 
- [ ] Consider a posteriori estimates. 
- [ ] Implement Deep Ritz solver for the Poisson equation.
