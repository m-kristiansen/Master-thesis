# Master thesis 
This readme will work as a workflow guide during the final masters year. It will contain the things that are done, how to proseed and maybe some remarks.

- [x] Create a solver for the Poisson equation with a manufactured solution using FEniCS. 
- [x] Prove Riesz representation theorem and the Lax Milgram theorem.
- [x] Derive the weak formulation of Poisson's equation for different BC's, with focus on why we choose the spesific trial and test spaces. 
- [x] Prove existence of solutions for the weak formulation of the Poisson equation with different BC's. 
- [ ] Compare weak and strong solution.
- [ ] Obtain estimates for the given functional.
