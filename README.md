# Master thesis 
This readme will work as a workflow guide during the final masters year. It will contain the things that are done, how to proseed and maybe some remarks.

- [x] Create a solver for the Poisson equation with a manufactured solution using FEniCS. 
- [x] Prove Riesz representation theorem and the Lax Milgram theorem.
- [x] Derive the weak formulation of Poisson's equation for different BC's, with focus on why we choose the spesific trial and test spaces. 
- [x] Prove existence of solutions for the weak formulation of the Poisson equation with different BC's. 
- [x] Obtain estimates for the given functional. (Ellipticity and boundedness)
- [ ] (maybe) Discuss how to better approximate the Poincare constant. 
- [x] Create simple square grid with straigth line intersection.
- [x] Implement solver. 
- [x] Evaluate with manufactured solutions. 
- [x] Compare expected and true convergence rates as a function of grid refinement with manufactured solutions. 
- [ ] Evaluate the error while increasing the gamma factor. 
- [ ] Consider a posteriori estimates. 
- [ ] Implement Deep Ritz solver for the Poisson equation.
